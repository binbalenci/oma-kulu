## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Data/Logic Issues

### 1. Transaction Income/Expense Type Bug âœ… FIXED
- [x] **Issue**: Transaction editing always converts to expense, doesn't understand income
- **Root Cause**: In `transactions.tsx` line 118, amount is hardcoded to negative: `amount: -Math.abs(amt)`
- **Location**: `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx:118`
- **Solution**: Added category type detection - positive amount for income categories, negative for expense categories
- **Files Modified**: `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` (lines 115-121, 489)
- **Priority**: HIGH - Breaks core functionality

### 2. Month Filtering Not Working in Transactions âœ… FIXED
- [x] **Issue**: Changing month in Transactions tab shows all transactions instead of filtering by selected month
- **Root Cause**: Recent transactions filter (line 84-86) doesn't include month filtering + no data refresh on month change
- **Location**: `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx:84-86`
- **Solution**: Added month-based filtering using startOfMonth/endOfMonth + added optimized data refresh on month changes (only fetching month-dependent data)
- **Files Modified**: `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` (lines 19, 34-50, 77-78, 86-94), `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (lines 44-62)
- **Priority**: HIGH - Core feature not working

### 3. "In Bank" Calculation Verification
- [ ] **Issue**: "In bank" amount might not match actual bank balance
- **Root Cause**: Calculation uses all transactions: `settings.starting_balance + transactions.reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0)`
- **Location**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx:156-157`
- **Hypothesis**: Logic issue - may need to exclude certain transaction types or add date filtering
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Financial accuracy concern

### 4. Category Updates Don't Reflect in Transactions âœ… FIXED
- [x] **Issue**: Updating categories creates new ones instead of updating existing transactions
- **Root Cause**: Transaction category is stored as string, not reference to category ID + Home tab category cache not refreshing
- **Location**: Multiple files - data model issue + frontend caching issue
- **Solution**: 
  - Added foreign key constraints with ON UPDATE CASCADE in Supabase database
  - Fixed Home tab useFocusEffect to reload ALL data (incomes, invoices, budgets) that may contain CASCADE updates
- **Database Migration**: Added FK constraints to expected_incomes, expected_invoices, budgets, and transactions tables
- **Code Changes**: Enhanced Home tab useFocusEffect to refresh incomes/invoices/budgets after category updates
- **Status**: âœ… FULLY FIXED - cascade updates working + complete data refresh on tab focus  
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Data consistency issue

## ðŸŸ  HIGH - UI/UX Issues

### 5. Category Dropdown Selection Issues âœ… FIXED
- [x] **Issue**: Dropdown shows values but can't select them, bottom navigation visible through dropdown
- **Root Cause**: Z-index conflicts in `SimpleDropdown` component and parent dialogs
- **Location**: `components/ui/SimpleDropdown.tsx`, `components/ui/Dialog.tsx`, `components/ui/SimpleDialog.tsx`
- **Solution**: 
  - Restored high `zIndex` to `SimpleDropdown` container
  - Added high `zIndex` to `Dialog` and `SimpleDialog` parent containers to ensure they render above all other content
- **Files Modified**: `components/ui/SimpleDropdown.tsx`, `components/ui/Dialog.tsx`, `components/ui/SimpleDialog.tsx`
- **Priority**: HIGH - Prevents category selection

### 6. Form Validation Missing âœ… FIXED
- [x] **Issue**: Add dialog allows saving without amount/category, shows toast but no visual cues
- **Root Cause**: No visual validation indicators in forms
- **Location**: Multiple dialog components
- **Solution**: 
  - Added red asterisk (*) to all required fields (Category, Amount, Category Name)
  - Implemented validation on Save button press - prevents dialog from closing if required fields are empty
  - Added visual feedback - field labels and placeholder text turn red when validation fails
  - Auto-clear errors when user starts typing in a field
  - Updated `Dialog` component to support async onSave with boolean return value
  - Updated `SimpleDropdown` to accept React.ReactNode labels and error prop
  - Moved category asterisk to placeholder text for better UI consistency
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Added validation for Category and Amount in Income/Invoice/Budget dialogs
  - `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` - Added validation for Category and Amount
  - `app/(tabs)/categories.tsx` - Added validation for Category Name
  - `components/ui/Dialog.tsx` - Updated to handle async onSave with boolean return
  - `components/ui/SimpleDropdown.tsx` - Updated to accept React.ReactNode labels and error prop
- **Status**: âœ… FULLY FIXED - validation working with visual feedback across all forms
- **Priority**: HIGH - Poor UX

### 7. Decimal Input Rounding Issues âœ… FIXED
- [x] **Issue**: Decimal values round up, .0 shows but entering decimals doesn't work properly
- **Root Cause**: Using `String()` conversion which strips trailing zeros from decimal numbers
- **Location**: Amount input fields across dialogs
- **Solution**: Changed to use `toFixed(2)` when loading amounts into edit forms to always display 2 decimal places
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Updated `openEditDialog` to format amounts with 2 decimal places (line 251)
  - `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` - Updated `handleEdit` to format amounts with 2 decimal places (line 184)
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Accuracy in financial data

### 8. Euro Symbol Missing in Input âœ… FIXED
- [x] **Issue**: Shows â‚¬ symbol in placeholder but not when entering values
- **Root Cause**: Input formatting doesn't preserve currency symbol - euro was only in placeholder
- **Location**: TextInput components for amounts
- **Solution**: Added `TextInput.Affix` with "â‚¬" text to the left side of amount inputs, changed placeholder from "â‚¬0.0" to "0.00"
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Added euro symbol affix to amount input (line 984)
  - `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` - Added euro symbol affix to amount input (line 513)
- **Priority**: LOW - UX enhancement

### 9. Navigation Tab Cut Off on Web âœ… RESOLVED
- [x] **Issue**: Bottom navigation partially cut off on certain screen resolutions (Edge on Windows)
- **Root Cause**: Edge-specific rendering issue, not a code problem
- **Location**: `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - reviewed, no issues found
- **Analysis**: 
  - Code uses standard Expo Router `<Tabs>` component with minimal customization
  - App properly wrapped in `SafeAreaProvider` at root level
  - Works correctly on Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Arc on macOS
  - Only observed on Edge browser on Windows - likely browser-specific quirk
  - No CSS issues or safe area problems found in codebase
- **Resolution**: No code changes needed - Edge-specific issue outside our control
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Platform compatibility (Edge-specific)

### 10. Cash Overview Takes Too Much Space
- [ ] **Issue**: Cash overview section too large in Home tab
- **Root Cause**: Layout and spacing design in overview card
- **Location**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx:591-653`
- **Hypothesis**: Frontend - need to optimize layout and spacing
- **Priority**: LOW - UI optimization

### 11. Duplicate Category Display in Transactions âœ… FIXED
- [x] **Issue**: Category shown on left (badge) and bottom (plain text) - redundant
- **Root Cause**: Transaction item layout was displaying category twice - once as a colored badge on the left and once as plain text in the metadata line
- **Location**: `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx:223-268`
- **Solution**: 
  - Moved category badge from left side to the metadata line (after the date)
  - Removed redundant category text from metadata line
  - Category badge now appears inline with the date: "Oct 19 [Badge]"
  - Removed unnecessary left margin from transaction info since badge is no longer on the left
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` - Restructured transaction item layout (lines 229-245) and updated styles (lines 716-731)
- **Priority**: LOW - UI cleanup

### 12. Category Dropdown Missing Emoji âœ… FIXED
- [x] **Issue**: Category dropdown should display emoji alongside names
- **Root Cause**: SimpleDropdown component wasn't receiving or rendering emoji data from categories
- **Location**: `components/ui/SimpleDropdown.tsx` and category dropdown usage in dialogs
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `SimpleDropdown` interface to accept optional `emoji` and `color` properties in data items
  - Modified dropdown to display emoji before category name in both selected value and dropdown list
  - Updated all category dropdown usages to pass emoji and color data from category objects
  - Emoji now appears as: "ðŸ›’ Grocery" instead of just "Grocery"
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `components/ui/SimpleDropdown.tsx` - Added emoji support to interface and rendering (lines 16, 34, 52-59, 95-96)
  - `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Updated category data mapping to include emoji and color (line 968)
  - `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` - Updated category data mapping to include emoji and color (line 540)
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - UX improvement

### 13. Dialog Field Order Inconsistency âœ… FIXED
- [x] **Issue**: Dialog fields in different orders across forms
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent form layout in different dialogs - Home tab started with Name/Category while Transactions tab started with Amount
- **Location**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` and `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx`
- **Solution**: Standardized field order across all financial dialogs to follow a logical flow:
  1. **Category** (required) - What type of transaction
  2. **Amount** (required) - How much
  3. **Description/Name** (optional) - Details about the transaction
  4. **Date** (for transactions only) - When it occurred
  5. **Notes** (optional) - Additional information
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` - Reordered fields: Category â†’ Amount â†’ Name â†’ Notes (lines 945-996)
  - `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` - Reordered fields: Category â†’ Amount â†’ Description â†’ Date (lines 504-544)
- **Priority**: LOW - Consistency

- **Root Cause**: Current design shows all transactions together
- **Location**: `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx`
- **Hypothesis**: Frontend - need to add section separation logic
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Feature enhancement

### 15. Report Tab Missing
- [ ] **Issue**: Need Report tab between transactions and categories showing monthly category breakdown
- **Root Cause**: Feature not implemented
- **Location**: New file needed
- **Hypothesis**: Frontend - new tab implementation with category grouping
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - New feature

### 16. Enhanced Category Selection UI
- [ ] **Issue**: Need top 10 most used categories with emoji and color in selection
- **Root Cause**: Current quick select doesn't show usage stats or visual elements

## ðŸŸ¢ LOW - Transaction Flow Issues

### 17. Expected Transaction Deletion Sync
- [ ] **Issue**: Deleting transactions created from expected items should mark them as unpaid in Home
- **Root Cause**: No bidirectional sync between transactions and expected items
- **Location**: Transaction deletion logic
- **Hypothesis**: Backend logic - need to track relationship and sync states
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Data consistency

### 18. Expected Transaction Editing Sync
- [ ] **Issue**: Editing transactions created from expected items should reflect in Home tab
- **Root Cause**: Same as above - no bidirectional sync
- **Location**: Transaction editing logic
- **Hypothesis**: Backend logic - need relationship tracking
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Data consistency

### 19. Home Tab Data Refresh âœ… FIXED (merged with #2)
- [x] **Issue**: Home tab should re-fetch data when entering to reflect changes  
- **Root Cause**: Data might be stale when returning to tab
- **Location**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` focus effect
- **Solution**: Fixed as part of month filtering issue (#2) - both tabs now refresh data on month changes
- **Files Modified**: See issue #2
- **Priority**: LOW - Data freshness

### 20. Money to Assign Text Change
- [ ] **Issue**: Change "Money to assign" to "Remaining to budget"
- **Root Cause**: Text label preference
