# Oma Kulu - Complete App Specification

## Core Philosophy

Oma Kulu ("My Expense" in Estonian) transforms manual spreadsheet tracking into an intuitive monthly financial planning system. The app shifts from reactive transaction logging to proactive allocation planning, mirroring the user's mental model of monthly "buckets" while solving critical pain points of payment tracking and category flexibility.

## Key Principles

- **Planning-First:** The budget view is the primary workspace, not historical reports
- **Two Critical Numbers:** "Amount Left to Assign" and "Actual Amount Left" always visible
- **Payment Tracking:** Expected invoices move from planning to history with one tap
- **Flexible Consistency:** Categories evolve with life changes while maintaining historical integrity
- **Multi-Month Planning:** Work on any month's budget with easy template copying
